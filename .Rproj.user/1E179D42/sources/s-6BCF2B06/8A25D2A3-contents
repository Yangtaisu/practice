To this data set, I selected the data of Mexico and Germany from 2005 to do a research. My conclusion is as I said, cardiovascular disease, Neoplasms and digestive disease are the top three causes of death in Mexico and Germany. The article written by @miller1997exercise said most of these diseases are caused by bad living habits. We should pay attention to this problem and call on all of us to change the bad lifestyle, keep exercising and have a regular diet. In this report, I used R package @tidyverse, @ggplot2 and @readr.
